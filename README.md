## Contributing

Before getting started, make sure you have Developer Mode enabled in your Discord.
If you're not sure how to enable it, go to `Settings > Advanced > Developer Mode: ON`

### Creating a branch

Whenever you want to contribute to any project, it is a good practice to make a separate branch and push it as a PR, rather than making changes to the main/master branch.

1. `git checkout -b <your-branch-name>` will make a separate branch and will change to that branch
2. Now you are ready to make your changes.


#### Fork the Project

Fork the project on Github by clicking on the word "Fork" above and to the right of this page.  This will create your own fork at https://github.com/yournamehere/Muskan--The-joy-of-giving-by-nature.git.  Then clone your fork to your local repository on your machine and set up a [triangle workflow](https://github.com/forwards/first-contributions/blob/master/additional-material/git_workflow_scenarios/keeping-your-fork-synced-with-this-repository.md)

using these commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/yournamehere/Muskan--The-joy-of-giving-by-nature.git
cd Muskan--The-joy-of-giving-by-nature
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Bhawna1203/Muskan--The-joy-of-giving-by-nature.git
```

#### Create a Branch for your feature

Make sure your fork is up-to-date and create a topic branch for your feature or bug fix.  (The name `my-feature-branch` is an example. Choose whatever you like.)

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

#### Build and Test

Ensure that you can build the project and run it on your mobile device before you create a pull request.


#### Write Code

Implement your feature or bug fix.

Make sure that your app builds and is successfully installed on your mobile device without errors.


#### Commit Changes

Make sure git knows your name and email address:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "contributor@example.com"
```

Add the changed files to the index using [git add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add).  Most IDEs make this easy for you to do, so you won't need this command line version.
Writing [good commit logs](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is important. A commit log should describe what changed and why.

```
git add ...
git commit -m "Fixed Foo bug by changing bar"
```

#### Push to your GitHub repository

```
git push origin my-feature-branch
```


#### Make a Pull Request

Go to https://github.com/yournamehere/Muskan--The-joy-of-giving-by-nature and select your feature branch. Click the 'Pull Request' button and fill out the form. Pull requests are usually reviewed within a few days.

If code review requests changes (and it usually will) just `git push` the changes to your repository on the same branch, and the pull request will be automatically updated.


#### Rebase

If you've been working on a change for a while and other commits have been made to the project, rebase with upstream/master.

```
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
git push origin my-feature-branch -f
```

#### Check on Your Pull Request

Go back to your pull request after a few minutes/days and see whether it passed the code-review 
Everything should be fine if your PR is green and successfully merged or code changes will be requested by the maintainers.

#### Be Patient

It's likely that your change will not be merged and that the nitpicky maintainers will ask you to do more, or fix seemingly benign problems like [choices of variable names](https://quotesondesign.com/phil-karlton/). Hang in there!
